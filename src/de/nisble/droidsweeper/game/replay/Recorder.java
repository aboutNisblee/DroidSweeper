/** {@link Replay} recorder.<br>
 * This class abstracts the recording of games. Because only real changes of
 * fields should be recorded, the procedure of recording a game needs a little
 * explanation.<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>An instance of this class should be registered as observer to
 * {@link MineSweeperMatrix} by passing it to
 * {@link MineSweeperMatrix#addMatrixObserver(MatrixObserver)}.</li>
 * <li>A new recording is started by calling {@link #newRecord(GameConfig)}.</li>
 * <li>When the player now clicks a field this class receives events over
 * changings in the of the game via the {@link MatrixObserver} interface. Each
 * click may cause multiple {@link Field fields} to change its state. So multiple
 * events are received and multiple changes are recorded for a single click (see
 * {@link Replay} for an explanation of the structure of a replay). Because for
 * this class its impossible to know which event is the last one for a click
 * (i.e. a single {@link TimeStep}) the help of the controlling instance is
 * needed.</li>
 * <li>So after a click is finished (all events are received) the controlling
 * instance must call {@link #finalizeStep(long)} to finish the record step. The
 * events are than stored inside a {@link Replay}.</li>
 * <li>After the game is finished and the last click is finished the
 * {@link Replay} can be requested by calling {@link #getReplay()}.</li>
 * </ol>
